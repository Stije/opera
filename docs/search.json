    "text": "Our Approach\nPreselecting anti-infectives by their capacity to reduce pathogen load enables more efficient use of trial resources, particularly for publicly funded research. Academia-led Phase 2 trials using pathogen clearance endpoints can serve as a public good—ensuring anti-infectives are developed efficiently, transparently, and in the interest of global health rather than solely commercial gain."

    "text": "Clinical infections occur when microorganisms breach the body’s natural defenses and replicate in places where they should not. Microorganisms become pathogenic when they cause direct tissue damage, lead to systemic infection, or induce harmful host responses. The extent of the damage is usually, if not always, proportional to the pathogen load. Any pre-existing immunity, whether from prior infection, vaccination, or both, that protects against a peak pathogen load, or anti-infectives that actively reduce it, are likely to prevent damage downstream. The link between pathogen burden and severity is intuitive: the more parasites in malaria, the more severe the disease; the more eggs in stool, the greater the burden of worm infections to the body; the higher the acid-fast bacillary load in sputum, the more severe the tuberculosis. The more infecting organisms there are - ​the worse is the disease."

    "text": "2. In acute infections​ the faster the infecting organisms are removed - ​the better is the outcome\nAlthough the principle that pathogen load drives disease severity is widely, if subconsciously accepted, clinical researchers often fail to apply it explicitly. The consequences are important. In drug trials of anti-infectives, the first question must be whether a drug is actually active against the causative pathogen. Yet extrapolating efficacy from laboratory or animal models to humans is notoriously inconsistent. If trials focus only on clinical outcomes without first establishing anti-pathogen activity, new drugs face unnecessarily rigid, extensive, expensive, and inefficient evaluation. Drug development pathways should therefore include a step to replicate and confirm the anti-infective effect in humans early. In acute infections​ the faster the infecting organisms are removed - ​the better is the outcome. With prior evidence that a drug reduces the pathogen faster than a natural infection or the best available alternative treatment, and by how much, subsequent trials can be more efficient by focusing only on candidates that demonstrate this ability."

    "text": "3. Measuring the rate at which the infecting organisms are removed reflects anti-infective drug efficacy​\nHow, then, should we concretely translate these principles into drug development? The answer is simple: Phase 2 studies in infectious diseases must include endpoints of pathogen clearance. Patient-related outcomes remain equally important, but they address a different and complementary question: beyond clearing the infectious pathogen, does the patient actually feel better? Before advancing to costly, prolonged Phase 3 trials, there must be evidence that an anti-infective can act on the pathogen itself. Measuring the rate at which the infecting organisms are removed reflects anti-infective drug efficacy. ​We therefore argue that drug development pathways should include an early go/no-go decision point based on anti-pathogen efficacy before committing to large-scale investment, and that regulatory authorities acknowledge this. This is crucial to concentrate the scarce public funds available for randomized clinical trials that serve global health and to advance the field of anti-infective drug development."
