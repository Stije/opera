## Our Mission

Safe and effective antimicrobial therapies must be treated as a global public good. Current drug development pathways fail to sustain the pipeline of treatments needed for pandemic threats. The OPERA mission is to accelerate the development of anti-infective therapies through efficient drug selection and testing based on measuring pathogen clearance.

## Our Approach

Preselecting anti-infectives by their capacity to reduce pathogen load enables more efficient use of trial resources, particularly for publicly funded research. Academia-led Phase 2 trials using pathogen clearance endpoints can serve as a public good—ensuring anti-infectives are developed efficiently, transparently, and in the interest of global health rather than solely commercial gain.
